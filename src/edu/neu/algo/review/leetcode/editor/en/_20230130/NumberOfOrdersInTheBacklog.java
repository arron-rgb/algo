public class NumberOfOrdersInTheBacklog {
  // 1801
  // You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei,
  // amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei
  // at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:
  //
  //
  // 0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
  // 1 if it is a batch of sell orders.
  //
  //
  // Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with
  // the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed
  // before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.
  //
  // There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The
  // backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:
  //
  //
  // If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest
  // price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the
  // current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order
  // will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
  // Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the
  // largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal
  // to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that
  // buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the sell order is added to the
  // backlog.
  //
  //
  // Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the
  // orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.
  //
  //
  // Example 1:
  //
  //
  // Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
  // Output: 6
  // Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
  // - 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so
  // the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
  // - 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders
  // with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
  // - 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with
  // prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the
  // backlog.
  // - 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are
  // matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell
  // orders are removed from the backlog. The 3 ≥·µà order is matched with the sell order of
  // the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog.
  // Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4·µó ∞ order is added to
  // the backlog.
  // Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with
  // price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.
  //
  //
  // Example 2:
  //
  //
  // Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
  // Output: 999999984
  // Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
  // - 10‚Åπ orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders,
  // so the 10‚Åπ orders are added to the backlog.
  // - 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3
  // sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed
  // from the backlog.
  // - 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a
  // sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
  // - 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy
  // order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the
  // backlog.
  // Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (9999999
  // 95-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991,
  // which is equal to 999999984 % (10‚Åπ + 7).
  //
  //
  //
  // Constraints:
  //
  //
  // 1 <= orders.length <= 10‚Åµ
  // orders[i].length == 3
  // 1 <= pricei, amounti <= 10‚Åπ
  // orderTypei is either 0 or 1.
  //
